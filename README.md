# Model-benchmarking-metric

This Python code implements an advanced climate model evaluation framework based on an extension of the traditional Taylor diagram. The objective of the code is to quantify and visualize the performance of climate models by introducing a three-dimensional error decomposition, which includes:

**Mean Error (ME)** – Bias between model output and observations.

**Variance Error (VE)** – Differences in the magnitude of variability.

**Correlation Error (CE)** – Differences in pattern or phase agreement.

Together, these components form a **Total Error (TE, consistent with Mean Square Error)** metric that is geometrically and mathematically consistent, enabling an accurate representation of model performance in three dimensions.
This framework can be extended to other forecast models or climate variables, and is useful for both researchers and operational forecasters seeking a more nuanced evaluation of model performance.
